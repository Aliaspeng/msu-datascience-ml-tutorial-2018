### Machine Learning with Pythong @ MSU Data Science 2018


![](images/logo.png)

This tutorial will teach you the basics of scikit-learn. I will give you a brief overview of the basic concepts of classification and regression analysis, and how to build powerful predictive models from labeled data. Although it's not a requirement for attending this tutorial, I highly recommend you to check out the accompanying GitHub repository at https://github.com/rasbt/msu-datascience-ml-tutorial-2018 1-2 days before the tutorial. During the session, we will not only talk about scikit-learn, but we will also go over some live code examples to get the knack of scikit-learn's API.   

If you have any questions about the tutorial, please don't hesitate to contact me. You can either open an "issue" on GitHub or reach me via email at mail_at_sebastianraschka.com. I am looking forward to meeting you soon!
